1. GLOBAL PURPOSE
Build a multi‑agent Bible study system that can interpret any verse or passage by analyzing:

Textual context

Translation differences

Original Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek root words

Historical and cultural background

Literary and canonical context

Theological and doctrinal perspectives

Practical application

The system must operate as a layered interpretation engine, not a simple Q&A bot.

2. DATA EMBEDDING REQUIREMENTS
The application must:

Embed the entire Bible in all versions provided by the developer (e.g., KJV, ESV, NIV, NKJV, NLT, etc.).

Store each version in a structured, queryable format.

Allow the user to click any verse and trigger the interpretation pipeline.

Maintain a mapping of:

Book → chapter → verse

Version → translation differences

Original language → Strong’s numbers → lexicon entries

The system must NOT hallucinate Bible text; it must only use the embedded versions.

3. AGENT ARCHITECTURE

## C. UI/UX flow for click‑to‑interpret

### 1. Main reading view

- **Layout:**
  - Left: Bible text (chapter view) with verse numbers as clickable elements.  
  - Top bar: version selector (ESV, KJV, etc.), search box, theme toggle.  
  - Right: collapsible “Study Panel”.

- **Interaction:**
  - **Click on a verse number** → highlight verse (or drag to select range).  
  - Floating action button appears: **“Run Interpretation”**.

---

### 2. Interpretation trigger

- User clicks **“Run Interpretation”**.  
- Modal or side panel shows:
  - Selected reference (e.g., “James 2:14–26”).  
  - Options:
    - Quick overview  
    - Full layered study  
    - Focus: word study / historical / doctrinal / application  

- Default: **Full layered study**.

---

### 3. Study panel layout

Once the pipeline runs, the right panel shows sections (accordion style):

1. **Summary interpretation**  
2. **Text & translation notes**  
3. **Word study**  
4. **Historical–cultural context**  
5. **Literary–canonical context**  
6. **Theological–doctrinal perspectives**  
7. **Application & reflection**

Each section is expandable/collapsible.  
Show small badges like “Textual”, “Historical”, “Theological” for quick scanning.

---

### 4. Word study interaction

- In the **Text** section, key terms are underlined.  
- Hover or click → small popup:
  - Lemma, Strong’s number, short gloss.  
  - “Open full word study” → jumps to Word Study section.

---

### 5. Version comparison

- Toggle in the Text section: **“Show version comparison”**.  
- Displays a small table:
  - Rows: versions  
  - Columns: verse text  
- Highlight differing phrases.

---

### 6. History & bookmarks

- Sidebar tab: **“My Studies”**

---

## D. Data model for Bible versions + lexicons

You can implement this in a relational DB or document store; here’s a clean conceptual model.

### 1. Bible text

**Table: `bible_versions`**

- `id` (PK)  
- `code` (e.g., "ESV")  
- `name`  
- `language`  
- `copyright_info`

**Table: `books`**

- `id` (PK)  
- `name` (e.g., "Genesis")  
- `canonical_order`  
- `testament` ("OT"/"NT")

**Table: `verses`**

- `id` (PK)  
- `book_id` (FK → books)  
- `chapter` (int)  
- `verse` (int)

**Table: `verse_texts`**

- `id` (PK)  
- `verse_id` (FK → verses)  
- `version_id` (FK → bible_versions)  
- `text` (string, full verse text)

This lets you query any verse in any version quickly.

---

### 2. Original language & Strong’s mapping

**Table: `lemmas`**

- `id` (PK)  
- `lemma` (e.g., "πίστις")  
- `language` ("Greek", "Hebrew", "Aramaic")  
- `strongs_number` (e.g., "G4102")

**Table: `lemma_definitions`**

- `id` (PK)  
- `lemma_id` (FK → lemmas)  
- `source` (e.g., "Strong", "BDAG")  
- `definition` (text)  
- `semantic_range` (JSON array)

**Table: `verse_lemma_links`**

- `id` (PK)  
- `verse_id` (FK → verses)  
- `lemma_id` (FK → lemmas)  
- `word_index` (position in verse)  
- `english_term` (surface form in a given version, optional)

---

### 3. Cross‑references & canonical links

**Table: `cross_references`**

- `id` (PK)  
- `from_verse_id`  
- `to_verse_id`  
- `type` (e.g., "thematic", "quotation", "allusion")  
- `note`

---

### 4. Historical & theological metadata (optional layer)

You can store curated metadata to support agents:

**Table: `book_metadata`**

- `book_id`  
- `traditional_author`  
- `audience`  
- `approx_date_range`  
- `genre`  
- `summary_themes` (JSON)

**Table: `tradition_notes`**

- `id`  
- `reference` (string, e.g., "James 2:14-26")  
- `tradition`  
- `summary` (short doctrinal note)
